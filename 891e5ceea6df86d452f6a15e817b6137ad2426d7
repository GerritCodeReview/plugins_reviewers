      "message": "I wasn\u0027t aware of Shawn\u0027s change.  I\u0027m not sure how much that is reusable given that it doesn\u0027t seem to be configurable.\n\nRegarding the stable branch, I don\u0027t think we need to be as strict about this as we are with core Gerrit.  Plenty of people are using Gerrit 2.11.x in production and I think it makes sense to make new plugin functionality available to those, as long as it doesn\u0027t depend on missing API functionality.",

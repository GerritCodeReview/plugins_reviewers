      "message": "Ok, I want to throw in another idea. You was saying that we can\u0027t use a $BUCKLET_HOME environment variable because we need an absolute path from the root directory of the project. Could we simply read $BUCKLET_HOME here and create the link to in the project root directory automatically if it is missing?",

      "message": "Sure, this would work. But do we really want to do that in automagical way? So the workflow would be:\n\n* 1. Check if bucklets exists in root directory (where .buckconfig is located)\n* 2. Optionally check that the root directory wasn\u0027t reached\n* 3. When bucklets directory/symbolic link doesn\u0027t exists, check for $BUCKLETS_HOME env var\n* 3.1 When $BUCKLETS_HOME doesn\u0027t exist, bail out\n* 3.2 When $BUCKLETS_HOME exists, create a symbolic links:\n\nAll three of them\n\n* ln -s $BUCKLETS_HOME ./bucklets\n* ln -s $BUCKLETS_HOME/buckversion ./.buckversion\n* ln -s $BUCKLETS_HOME/watchmanconfig ./.watchmanconfig\n\nSomething i was trying to achieve in its own shell script: [1]\n\n [1] https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/59823",

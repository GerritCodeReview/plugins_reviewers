      "message": "Ok, I want to throw in another idea. You was saying that we can\u0027t use a $BUCKLET_HOME environment variable because we need an absolute path from the root directory of the project. Could we simply read $BUCKLET_HOME here and create the link to in the project root directory automatically if it is missing?",

      "message": "Sure, this would work. But do we really want to do that in automagical way? So the workflow would be:\n\n* 1. Check if bucklets exists in root directory (where .buckconfig is located)\n* 2. Optionally check that the root directory wasn\u0027t reached\n* 3. When bucklets directory/symbolic link doesn\u0027t exists, check for $BUCKLETS_HOME env var\n* 3.1 When $BUCKLETS_HOME doesn\u0027t exist, bail out\n* 3.2 When $BUCKLETS_HOME exists, create a symbolic links:\n\nAll three of them\n\n* ln -s $BUCKLETS_HOME ./bucklets\n* ln -s $BUCKLETS_HOME/buckversion ./.buckversion\n* ln -s $BUCKLETS_HOME/watchmanconfig ./.watchmanconfig\n\nSomething i was trying to achieve in its own shell script: [1]\n\n [1] https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/59823",

But do we really want to do that \n \u003e in automagical way?\n\nI see that it\u0027s quite some steps in the implementation, but I think it could make the usage really easier.\n\nAs a user I would see this picture:\n\n 1. clone first plugin repo and try to build it with buck:\n    \"Error: $BUCKLET_HOME not set\n     Clone the bucklets repo from ... and set $BUCKLET_HOME \n     to the local directory of your bucklet clone\"\n\n 2. clone bucklets repo and set $BUCKLET_HOME\n\n 3. build the plugin with Buck and it works\n\n 4. clone more plugin repos and build them with Buck and it \n    just works\n\nSo as a user I only once need to set $BUCKLET_HOME and then it just works for all plugins. At the moment I still need to create the links for every plugin which is more work for me as a user.",

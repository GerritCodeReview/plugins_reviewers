But then any additional accounts would also be added by blame.\n\nIf there is overlap, i.e. the core maintainers are the ones that touched most of the code, it has no effect.\n\nIf there is concern about too many reviewers being added, this can be fixed by limiting the number of reviewers added by blame (this is already partially implemented; just need to wire in the configuration setting).\n\nWe could also consider adding a score threshold to limit which reviewers are added by blame.",

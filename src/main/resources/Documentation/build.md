Build
=====

This plugin can be built with Bazel or Maven.

Two build modes are supported: Standalone and in Gerrit tree.
The standalone build mode is recommended, as this mode doesn't require
the Gerrit tree to exist locally.

### Build standalone

```
  bazel build @PLUGIN@
```

The output is created in

```
  bazel-genfiles/@PLUGIN@.jar
```

This project can be imported into the Eclipse IDE:

```
  ./tools/eclipse/project.sh
```

### Build in Gerrit tree

```
  bazel build plugins/@PLUGIN@
```

The output is created in

```
  bazel-genfiles/plugins/@PLUGIN@/@PLUGIN@.jar
```

This project can be imported into the Eclipse IDE.
Add the plugin name to the `CUSTOM_PLUGINS` set in
Gerrit core in `tools/bzl/plugins.bzl`, and execute:

```
  ./tools/eclipse/project.py
```

Maven
-----

Note that the Maven build is provided for compatibility reasons, but
it is considered to be deprecated and will be removed in a future
version of this plugin.

To build with Maven, run

```
  mvn clean package
```

When building with Maven, the Gerrit Plugin API must be available.

How to build the Gerrit Plugin API is described in the [Gerrit
documentation](../../../Documentation/dev-bazel.html#_extension_and_plugin_api_jar_files).

Configuration
=============

Global configuration of the @PLUGIN@ plugin is done in the
`reviewers.config` file in the site's `etc` directory.

```
  [reviewers]
    enableREST = true
    suggestOnly = false
    ignoreWip = true
    ignorePrivate = true
```

reviewers.enableREST
:	Enable the REST API. When set to false, the REST API is not available.
	Defaults to true.

reviewers.suggestOnly
:	Provide the configured reviewers as suggestions in the "Add Reviewer" dialog
	instead of automatically adding them to the change. Only supports accounts;
	groups are not suggested. Defaults to false. By default Gerrit will consider
	the suggestions with a weight of 1. To force the suggestions higher in the
	list, set a higher value (like 1000) in `addReviewer.@PLUGIN@-reviewer-suggestion.weight`
	in `gerrit.config`.

reviewers.ingoreWip
:	Ignore changes in WIP state. When set to true changes in WIP state are not
	considered when adding reviewers. Defaults to true. To enable adding
	reviewers on changes in WIP state set this value to false.

revewers.ignorePrivate
:	Ignore changes in private state. When set to true changes in private state
	are not considered when adding reviewers. Defaults to true. To enable
	adding reviewers on changes in Private state set this value to false.
Per project configuration of the @PLUGIN@ plugin is done in the
`reviewers.config` file of the project. Missing values are inherited
from the parent projects. This means a global default configuration can
be done in the `reviewers.config` file of the `All-Projects` root project.
Other projects can then override the configuration in their own
`reviewers.config` file.

```
  [filter "*"]
    reviewer = john.doe@example.com

  [filter "branch:main file:^lib/.*"]
    reviewer = jane.doe@example.com

  [filter "branch:stable-2.10"]
    reviewer = QAGroup

```

filter.\<filter\>.reviewer
:	An account or a group name. Must be an exact match (case sensitive) with the
	account's email address or username, or the group name.  Multiple `reviewer`
	occurrences are allowed.

##Multiple filter matches

The plugin supports multiple filter matches.

###Example

```
  [filter "file:^build/modules/.*"]
    reviewer = john.doe@example.com

  [filter "file:^build/.*"]
    reviewer = jane.doe@example.com

```

1. Push a change for review involving file "build/modules/GLOBAL.pm".
2. Both john.doe@example.com and jane.doe@example.com get added or suggested as reviewers.

Configuration
=============

The configuration of the @PLUGIN@ plugin is done on project level in
the `project.config` file of the project. Missing values are inherited
from the parent projects. This means a global default configuration can
be done in the `project.config` file of the `All-Projects` root project.
Other projects can then override the configuration in their own
`project.config` file.

```

    reviewer = jane.doe@example.com
    reviewer = QAGroup
```

plugin.reviewers.reviewer
:	An account (email or full user name) or a group name. Multiple
	`reviewiers` are allowed.

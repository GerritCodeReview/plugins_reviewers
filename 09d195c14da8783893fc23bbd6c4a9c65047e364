      "message": "I am not sure I like such cryptical Ids. An alternative approach would be to use named sections? Say, application has 4 code areas, then project owner could upload 4 named sections:\n\n* sshd\n* httpd\n* server\n* ui\n\nsomething like this:\n\n  PUT /projects/myproject/reviewers-sections/httpd\t\n  {\n    \"filter\": \"dir:httpd\"\n    \"reviewer\": \"Alice\"\n  }\n\n  PUT /projects/myproject/reviewers-sections/ui\n  {\n    \"filter\": \"dir:ui\"\n    \"reviewer\": \"Bob\"\n  }\n\n\nand use it like a key? Diadvantage is , of course, we would need additional input, that however may also be used as documentation.",

I\u0027m Gerrit user and track Gerrit development to understand more deeply what to expect in the next release.\n\nI\u0027m thrilled with this change, as it might seem to solve issue [1].\nIs this change makes plugin remember the state in case reviewer was removed manually from change or it\u0027s only about CC \u003c-\u003e reviewer state change?\n\nBTW, could Gerrit maintainers set proper component \"plugin-reviewers\" for [1] and [2].\n\n[1] https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id\u003d5707\n[2] https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id\u003d5708",

      "message": "Thanks, David for the initiative. I agree that this is very useful \"adding reviewers\" operation mode and should be handled by this plugin. If you remember, the only reason I created this plugin, is just because I wanted to add \"adding reviewers by configuration\" operation mode to the reviewers-by-blame plugin, but Deniz rejected my patch in this comment: [1] (for the link to work properly, use PolyGerrit UI).\n\nMy proposal would be to have three major modes:\n\n* adding reviewers per configuration\n* adding reviewers by blame\n* suggesting reviewers per configuration\n* suggesting reviewers by blame\n\nMoreover, I already commented on your change, where you introduced reveiwers suggestion mode: We should allow a mixed mode, e.g. Allowing different mode across different projects or even branches. We should just find out, what would be a non invasive way to allow this additional Reviewers-plugin-mode property in plugin configuration files, and of course we have to introduce it in backwards compatible way, and thoroughly choose the right default behaviour.\n\n* [1] https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/plugins/reviewers-by-blame/+/51073/#message-38a8800c67424fa5295df43819e3cad08a2775f9",

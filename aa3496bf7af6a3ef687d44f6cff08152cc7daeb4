Instead we are explicitly sharing the css strings via a new plugin API, see this change for more details: https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/317791.\n\nI will leave this comment unresolved for making sure to sync past the above change before submitting.\n\nNote that we are trying to offer smaller and more targeted sets of shared style rules. `shared-styles` was too big a grab bag of stuff. Let me know if you would like to have access to other style rules. We should be able to make that happen. :-)",

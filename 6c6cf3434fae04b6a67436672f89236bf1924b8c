We could use this variable from the BUCK scripts and print out an error if it is not set. The advantage with this approach would be that I only need to set this variable once and then it would work for all plugins, whilst now I need to create the symbolic link for each and every plugin.",

You need absolute path from root directory of your project. But this is one of the most wanted features, though, to be able to reuse cross projects rules.
